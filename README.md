# Final-Year-Project-Student-Management-LMS-
It's a web portal to manage the working of final year students and their project at GIFT University. It also includes the AI based automatic 1 click scheduler for presentation scheduling. We build it using Genetic Algorithm.

Capstone management is being done manually already in GIFT university, as student submit their proposals by hand to coordinator. Coordinator send them list of available supervisors through email, FYP committee gives feedback of presentations to coordinator on paper and then he/she send it to student groups. So, all the working is manually. We build a web application which is dedicated to this whole process and we want all stakeholders on a dedicated platform. Coordinator will register students in the system and then students will be able to select their supervisors and ideas for project. After approvals they will be in list of FYP students in form of groups. Coordinator can schedule presentations. FYP committee members can give feedback using system and it will be directly sent to the students. Students may contact their supervisor using system.
